# Badgeville RESTful Wrapper for Berlin API (Basic README)

This is a Ruby wrapper for interacting with the [Badgeville RESTful Berlin API](http://rules.badgeville.com/display/doc/2.0+Core+API+Documentation).

## Features
* Uses the activeresource (3.0.5) gem to map ActiveModel-like RESTful methods to resources on the remote Badgeville server.
* Uses a logger to print HTTP requests to the standard output stream.

##Basic Examples

### Add a new site to your network. Find your network ID the Publisher Module's tabbed menu Develop > Home or contact support@badgeville.com.
```ruby
new_site = Badgeville::Site.new(
  :name => "My Website",
  :url => "mydomain.com",
  :network_id => '4d5dc61ed0c0b32b79000001' )
success = new_site.save
```

### Create a user to add them to your network.

```ruby
new_user = User.new(  :name => 'visitor_username',
                      :network_id => '4d5dc61ed0c0b32b79000001',
                      :email => 'visitor@emailserver.com',
                      :password => 'visitor_password' )
success = new_user.save
```

# Examples

## Create an instance for interacting with Badgeville

```ruby
@badgeville = Badgeville::API.new('thisisyourbadgevilleapikey')
```

## Create a user and then a player for that user

```ruby
badgeville_response = @badgeville.create_user(
  :user => {
    :name => 'Player Name',
    :email => 'player_name@yoursite.com'
  }
)

badgeville_response = @badgeville.create_player(:email => 'player_name@yoursite.com',
  :site => 'yoursite.com', :player => {:email => 'player_name@yoursite.com'}, :verbose => true)
```

## Create an activity definition

```ruby
badgeville_response = @badgeville.create_activity_definition(
  :activity_definition => {
    :site_id => '4d700bd351c21c1e3c000004',
    :name => 'API test (V2) activity - gem test',
    :selector => '{"verb":"api_test_v2_gem"}',
    :adjustment => '{"points":5}'
  }
)
```

## Create a reward definition

```ruby
badgeville_response = @badgeville.create_reward_definition(
  :reward_definition => {
    :site_id => '4d700bd351c21c1e3c000004',
    :name => 'API test (V2) reward - gem test',
    :components => '[{"comparator":{"$gte":1},"command":"count","where":{"verb":"api_test_v2_gem","user_id":"%user_id","site_id":"%site_id"}}]',
    :reward_template => '{"message":"Congratulations! You\'ve won the API test V2 badge!"}',
    :tags => 'API,test,v2',
    :active => true
  }
)
```

## Create a reward definition with an image

```ruby
badgeville_response = @badgeville.create_reward_definition(
  :reward_definition => {
    :site_id => '4d700bd351c21c1e3c000004',
    :name => 'API test (V2) reward with image - gem test',
    :components => '[{"comparator":{"$gte":1},"command":"count","where":{"verb":"api_test_v2_image","user_id":"%user_id","site_id":"%site_id"}}]',
    :reward_template => '{"message":"Congratulations! You\'ve won the API test V2 badge with an image!"}',
    :tags => 'API,test,v2',
    :image => File.new('/this/is/the/path/to/the/image/game_badge.jpg'),
    :active => true
  }
)
```

## Submit activity for a player

```ruby
badgeville_response = @badgeville.create_activity(
  :player_id => '4ee7bc0c3dc64810b0000157',
  :activity => {:verb => 'api_test_v2_gem'}
)
```

### NOTE

The gem does not attempt to automatically parse the response from Badgeville. You will need to do this in the calling code. Example:

```ruby
parsed_response = JSON.parse(badgeville_response.body)
```

# Compatibility

The gem has been built under Ruby 1.9.3, but should be fine to use under Ruby 1.9.2 or Ruby 1.8.7.

# Contributing to badgeville

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
