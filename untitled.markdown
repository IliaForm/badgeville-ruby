Badgeville RESTful Wrapper for Berlin API (Basic README)

This is a Ruby wrapper for the Badgeville RESTful Berlin API.
Features

    Uses the activeresource (3.0.5) gem to map ActiveModel-like RESTful methods to resources on the remote Badgeville server.
    Uses a logger to print HTTP requests to the standard output stream.

Basic Examples

    Add a new site to your network.

    Find your network ID the Publisher Module's tabbed menu Develop > Home or contact support@badgeville.com. ruby new_site = Site.new( :name => "My Website", :url => "mydomain.com", :network_id => '4d5dc61ed0c0b32b79000001' ) success = new_site.save
    Create a user to add them to your network.

    ```ruby
    new_user = User.new(  :name => 'visitor_username',
                          :network_id => '4d5dc61ed0c0b32b79000001',
                          :email => 'visitor@emailserver.com',
                          :password => 'visitor_password' )
    success = new_user.save
    ```

    Find the newly created user by ID to update their email address.

    ```ruby
    user_found_by_id       = User.find( new_user.id )
    user_found_by_id.email = 'revised_visitor@emailserver.com'
    success                = user_found_by_id.save
    ```

    Create a player using the user corresponding to the updated email address for the site mydomain.com.

    ```ruby
    new_player = Player.new(  :site_id => new_site.id,
                              :user_id => new_user.id )
    success   = new_player.save
    ```

    Register a player behavior (comment) for the newly created player.

    ```ruby
    new_activity = Activity.new(  :verb => 'comment',
                                  :player_id => new_player.id )
    success = new_activity.save
    ```
