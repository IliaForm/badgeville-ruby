Basic Example Usage
-------------------

### Add a new site to your network.
        ```ruby
        new_site = Site.new(  :name => "My Website",
                              :url => "mydomain.com",
                              :network_id => '4d5dc61ed0c0b32b79000001' )
        success = new_site.save
        ```

### Create a user to add them to your network.
        ```ruby
        new_user = User.new(  :name => 'visitor_username',
                              :network_id => '4d5dc61ed0c0b32b79000001',
                              :email => 'visitor@emailserver.com',
                              :password => 'visitor_password' )
        success = new_user.save
        ```

### Find the newly created user by ID to update their email address.
        ```ruby
        user_found_by_id       = User.find( new_user.id )
        user_found_by_id.email = 'revised_visitor@emailserver.com'
        success                = user_found_by_id.save
        ```

### Create a player using the user corresponding to the updated email address for the site mydomain.com.
        ```ruby
        new_player = Player.new(  :site_id => new_site.id,
                                  :user_id => new_user.id )
        success   = new_player.save
        ```

### Register a player behavior (comment) for the newly created player.
        ```ruby
        new_activity = Activity.new(  :verb => 'comment',
                                      :player_id => new_player.id )
        success = new_activity.save
        ```
