#Badgeville RESTful Wrapper for Berlin API (Advanced README)
This is a Ruby wrapper for the Badgeville RESTful Berlin API.

##Getting Started
* Please check out the [Basic README](https://github.com/badgeville/badgeville-ruby/blob/alpha/badgeville_wrapper_project/README.md) first.

##Advanced Example Usage

1. ### Create an activity definition to specify that a player will earn 4 points each time they perform the "comment" behavior.
        ```ruby
        new_activity_definition = ActivityDefinition.new( :adjustment => {:points => 4},
                                                          :name => 'comment_earns_4points',
                                                          :site_id => new_site.id,
                                                          :verb => 'comment' )
        success = new_activity_definition.save
        ```

2. ### Update the activity definition such that a player on your site will earn 3 points rather than 4 each time they perform the "comment" behavior. [(more)](http://rules.badgeville.com/display/doc/Creating+and+Managing+Behaviors)
        ```ruby
        new_activity_definition.adjustment.points = 3
        success = new_activity_definition.save
        ```

3. ### Update the activity definition to include a rate limit in order to block players from gaming the system. [(more)](http://rules.badgeville.com/display/doc/Creating+and+Managing+Behaviors#CreatingandManagingBehaviors-CreatingSimpleBehaviors) Set bucket_rate_limit to 180 (20 comments per hour). Why? 180 (3600 (number of seconds in an hour) / 20 comments = 180 s. This will drain 1 comment every 3 minutes. Set bucket_max_capacity to 25. Why? This allows the player to create 25 comments as fast as they like, after which the bucket will begin to drain.

          ```ruby
          new_activity_definition.enable_rate_limiting = true
          new_activity_definition.bucket_drain_rate    = 180
          new_activity_definition.bucket_max_capacity  = 25
          new_activity_definition.save
          ```

4. ### Reward definitions define numerous criteria that must be met for a player to earn a reward. Create a reward definition to reward a player when they have made two comments.
        
        ```ruby
        new_reward_definition =
          RewardDefinition.new( :site_id          => new_site.id,
                                :name             => 'reward_2comments',
                                :reward_template  => { :message => 'Congrats!' },
                                :components       => {  :command => 'count',
                                                        :comparator => 2,
                                                        :where => { :verb => 'comment', :player_id => '%player_id' }
                                                      } )
        success = new_reward_definition.save
        ```
